## 8. Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] Share sheet testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] App store submission

## MVP Success Metrics
- 1,000+ downloads in first month
- 60%+ retention after 7 days
- Average 20+ saves per user
- 30% create 3+ collections
- 20% share collections

## Post-MVP Roadmap
- **Phase 2**: AI features (summary, extraction, auto-categorization)
- **Phase 3**: Premium features and monetization
- **Phase 4**: Web app and browser extension
- **Phase 5**: Collaborative features and social elements 

## Dependencies
- React Native
- Supabase (Database + Auth)
- Node.js/Express (Optional lightweight backend)
- Open Graph / oEmbed APIs
- Native platform APIs (iOS/Android sharing)

## Technical Architecture (Simplified)

### Frontend:
- React Native app
- Supabase client integration
- Native share sheet integration
- Image caching and preview generation

### Backend:
- Supabase for database and auth
- Optional lightweight Express server for link processing
- Open Graph metadata extraction
- Simple preview image caching

### Database Schema:
```
Users: id, email, created_at
Collections: id, user_id, name, description, cover_image, is_public, share_token
Items: id, user_id, url, title, description, image_url, platform, notes, tags, created_at
Collection_Items: collection_id, item_id, order
```
